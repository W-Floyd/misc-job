# Resume and CV Templating

Borrowing the core Jinja2 templating idea from [Davide Pucci's 'erro'](https://davidepucci.it/doc/erro/), I have written my own bash script to build it for my needs. It utilizes j2 for the templating. The LaTeX document is also currently an old modified version of his personal template.

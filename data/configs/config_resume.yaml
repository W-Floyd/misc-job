        description: >
          Led Software Defined Radio (SDR) development for GPS transmission purposes (using C++).
          Utilized existing software PPRX to interpret sampled radio signals and read GPS data.
          Development focused on extensible rogue signal generation in software utilizing timing data from PPRX, accounting for constraints including material properties, moving body velocities, radio signal time of flight, and transmission latency.
          Co-owned both public and limited release progress reports delivered to Sandia National Labs, as well as final technical reports.
          Additionally co-owned mechanical design for electronics housing and thermal performance for driving computer system.
